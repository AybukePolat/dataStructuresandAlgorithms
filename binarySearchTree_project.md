- Binary Search Tree

-A binary search tree is a type of binary tree used to organize data.

-Binary Search Tree consists of nodes. Each node has at most 2 child nodes.

-Nodes with a value less than root are located to the left of Root.

-Nodes with a value greater than root are located to the right of Root.

-This rule applies to subtrees on the left and right sides as Recursive.





1- Write the Binary-Search-Tree stages of the sequence.

Example: root is x. y is found to the right of root. To its left is a z, etc.
