- Insertion Sort

[22,27,16,2,18,6]

1- Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the sort type.

| 22  | 27  | 16  | 2  | 18  | 6  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 16  | 22  | 27  | 2  | 18  | 6  |
| 2  | 16  | 22  | 27  | 18  | 6  |
| 2  | 16  | 18  | 22  | 27  | 6  |
| 2  | 6  | 16  | 18  | 22  | 27  |

2- Write the Big-O notation.

- Big O Notation:  n*(n+1)/2 --> <b>O(n^2)</b>

3- Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle. Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end. Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n)

4- After the array is sorted, please write if the number 18 is the average case, worst case or best case.

- Average case. (18 is one of the two numbers in the middle of the array.)


* Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.

| 7  | 3  | 5  | 8  | 2  | 9  | 4  | 15  | 6  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 3  | 7  | 5  | 8  | 2  | 9  | 4  | 15  | 6  |
| 3  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 2  | 9  | 4  | 15  | 6  | 
| 2  | 3  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 4  | 15  | 6  |
| 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 15  | 6  |
